## ⚙️ Firmware compile using PIO
Open project with Vscode, wait for PlatformIO to configure the project.

## How to get simulator work on Windows
Clone project.  
Open project with Vscode, wait for PlatformIO to configure the project.  
Download Visual Studio 2019.(can't work with 2022)  
Install module: C++ desktop(click on MSVC v142-VS 2019) and .NET desktop.  
Open the .sln file, select x86 Debug and run.  
Then the simulator should can work.  


## How to get simulator work on MacOS
todo 
some basic function don't work under Mac c++ env.

## Software Part Understanding
### Software Init Pipeline
Setup:  
* HAL_init;  
    * buzz: thread(tailored in this project)  
*	Port_Init //LCD  
    * Tft object setup, binding with LVGL  
    * Create FreeRTOS task  
*	App_init  
    * Init data buffer, lv clear, init resourse, create apps, bind service  

Loop:  
*	HAL_update  

After that, the FreeRTOS will periodically call lv_handler, which gives lvgl heart beat.  
The software structure and lvgl outside of FreeRTOS will listen from input and periodic timers to do its job.  

### Software Structure (explaination on content)
#### FreeRTOS
* Task1: lvgl update  
* Task2: pending: HAL update 
* Task3: pending: switch between LCD and Eink 
plan : using state machine to control the shift between normal mode and low power mode.  
#### Data Buffer:
Namespace DataProc:  

class:  
Account:   
all account connect to one data center. Using an id to distinguish.   
Having a general pingpong buffer and a specified user data pointer.  
Using commit to get data and use publish to notify all subscriber with new data.  
Can data can be pull from subscriber.  
Timer’s utility? Cmd utility?  

DataCenter:  
Provide find specific account utility.  
Store accounts using account pool, which is a vector.  

Pingpong buffer:  

    void* buffer[2];
        volatile uint8_t writeIndex;
        volatile uint8_t readIndex;
        volatile uint8_t readAvaliable[2];
          
readidx=0 or 1. After read, set avai to 0.  
Write: can not be the same with read. Write to another slot and set its availability to 1.  

#### App
AppFactory: public inherited from PageFactory  
Provide createpage check function. Check whether “create a page named xx” is legal. Then return the page object  

PageManager: manage pages. Install, register, push&pop of page stack, page switch and the other stuff.  
Organized the page-switching logic!  
Install of page: init page, assign some information of this page.  
Register of page: assign PM’s this pointer, assign page name to itself (?), pushback in pagepool  

Page stack and page pool:  
Page stack is used to store the sequence of appearance of pages. Page pool is used to check whether a page is registered or not.  

The app will show after it is pushed into the stack by calling “SwitchTo”  
Switch to: detect and copy stash into the target page.  

The PM will raise StateUpdate to check the state and call corresponding functions in pages (state machine)  


App使用MVC框架  
[基本概念参考:](https://www.zhihu.com/question/27897315)  
[详细细节以及 IOS viewcontroler：](https://www.jianshu.com/p/caaa173071f3)  
[跟MVP的区别？](http://c.biancheng.net/view/7743.html) 然后会发现mvc的定义出现了分歧  


实现了页面调度（生命周期）的功能  
移植 通过push添加页面进池，pop弹出当前页面回到上一个页面  
确认硬件没有初始化导致systeminfo会引用空指针  
添加其他页面  

Page：接口功能，包括创建，显示，加载等  
PageView：功能实现，如创建，建组等  
PageModel：数据交互功能，如读取数据更新等  

onBtnClicked called by onEvent. onEvent is a callback function, which is attached to events by lv_obj_add_event_cb In onEvent

The onEvent will call different functions based on the event code.  

The information updates of map and dialplate are done by lv_timer  

#### Button and Lvgl
Encoder_Init provide: hardware interrupt when a pin changed, attach encoder with buttonEvent  
Bind encoder in the Encoder_Init only provide long press power off feature(disable encoder difference calc)  
Encoder_Update will call ButtonEvent’s EventMonitor, which judge the state of press. This can determin whether device should be power off.  

Lvgl determines press event using the encoder_read call-back function. It reads diff and state from encoder driver.  
#### Map
Using Microsoft Tiled map system: different scale, different image.   
Which uses scale number to calculate the crop of an image.  

Namespace page  
Class livemap :pagebase  

MapConv mapConv;  
TileConv tileConv;  

When things are being updated. Enter or outside from map?
Using lv_poly_line to record track line


Observation: the map will exit when button is pressed(before release)
#### Resource Pool
Import fonts, label images
